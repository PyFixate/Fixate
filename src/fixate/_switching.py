"""
JigDriver is all about switching signals in a jig (and also input, but I'm
ignoring that for now...) At the script level, the key abstraction is a
`VirtualMux`, which switching between a number of `Signals`. Each signal is
defined by a number of `Pins`. When using a relay matrix, a Signal often
corresponds to a single Pin, but it doesn't have to.

Each VirtualMux connects to the VirtualAddressMap. When the multiplex is
called on a mux, the mux determines which pin must be set or cleared
