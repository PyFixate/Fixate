# mypy will be incrementally added to the project
# for some reason mypy gives different output if a project is installed in editable mode
# due to how imports are followed
# don't bother with checking tests yet

# the initial goal is to add in as much as possible, without editing any source files
# adding # type: ignore comments everywhere is messy and I'd rather it be used as a last
# resort to suppress a one-off in an otherwise fully typed file
# see https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html for a list of common fixes
# but preferably edit the config file to filter out broken stuff, rather than per line edits
# the advantage with editing the config rather than suppressing things inline is that there is
# one location to look at in regards to how mypy behaves, and random parts of the code won't be
# ignored and forgotten about due to scattered comments that locally disable type checking

[mypy]
# python_version = # defaults to interpreter version
# tests are severely broken and seem to be confusing the mypy path, so don't include for now
files = scripts,src/fixate/
ignore_missing_imports=true

# here is all the broken stuff to eventually fix up
# this list should not be added to
# delete entries from here as things get worked on
# if things break in the future from turning on new rules,
# then they should be locally disabled for the module they break
# (or fix the actual error)
# WARNING - this confval is not a list of files, it is actually a regex
# as an example of what can go wrong to the ill informed see below
# ...

#    (
#        __init__.py <- deleting this line
#        |helper.py <- without removing the prepended | on this line
#    )
# ... will end up excluding all files within the config folder, rather than just helper.py
# https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-exclude
# the -v flag can be used to inspect the files actually excluded
